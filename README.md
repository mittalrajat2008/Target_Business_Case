# Approach Used

This project analyzes Target's e-commerce operations in Brazil, focusing on customer orders, payments, freight costs, and delivery timelines. The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure, followed by examining order trends, seasonality, and customer distribution across Brazilian states. Key metrics like order prices, freight costs, and delivery times are explored, alongside comparisons between actual and estimated delivery dates to assess logistics efficiency. The project also investigates payment method trends and installment-based orders, offering insights to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.
